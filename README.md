# Hi, I'm Daniel Ramírez

**Product Engineer (Fullstack & Cloud)** from Chile. Started debugging with Stack Overflow, Reddit, and random GitHub repos before AI was a thing. Now a vibecoder who mass-prompts until it works, then mass-prompts again when it doesn't.

I've built and shipped **$66K+ ARR** in SaaS products from scratch, bridging the gap between scalable infrastructure and real user needs. My background is a mix of "move fast" founder energy and "don't crash prod" engineering discipline. Most of my infrastructure experience is on **AWS**.

Currently focused on distributed systems, cost-efficient cloud architectures, and convincing LLMs to write working code on the first try.
